                Thinking is important, and thinking about thinking
                is also important. But too many people neglect both.
                People hold beliefs, but few stop to ask why
                they believe what they believe.

                <!--The problem of evil does not conclusively disprove god
                but it does conclusively disprove certain versions of god
                many theists claim that their god is omnipotent and
                omnibenevolent, that is all powerful and all loving
                but that doesn't match up with the world we see
                the only way out of the dilemna is to give up
                one of the omni characteristics for their god
                and every argument theists come up with to try to escape
                this dilemna ends up tacitly or explicitly
                giving up one or both of the omni traits
                often without them realizing it
                they either accidentally put arbitrary limits on god's power
                thus taking away his omnipotence
                or they accidentally admit that god's love has limits
                thus taking away his omnibenevolence
                I know this isn't soemthing most people find interesting
                but I do, so I felt like including it.
                Though I know going forward notes should be used
                primarily to clarify what certain lines of code
                are intended to do
                to make things easier both for other coders
                and also myself if I come back to it later
                given how fallible human memory is
                having detailed notes is good
                but this page is fairly basic
                so I figured notes would probably be redundant
                in this case.-->
